# BINARY HEAP

## Balanced Binary Tree
- O(log n) insertion worst time complexity
- O(log n) searching worst time complexity
- O(log n) Removing an element worst time complexity

`Priority Queue will be implemented in binary heap`

## Binary Heap
- inserting an element is O(log n) time complexity
- accessing an element with the highest priority is O(1)
- Removing an element is O(log n) time complexity
- binary heap can be represented as an array
- binary heap can be of two types. MAX HEAP or MIN HEAP
- if the height of the tree is h. the leaf nodes should be at h or h-1
- the heap should form a complete binary tree - all levels should be filled except the child nodes, 
  the child nodes should be filled from the left side
- sd

    ### MIN HEAP
    - the node value should be less than or equal to it's children
    - the smallest element should be at the root node
    
    ### MAX HEAP
    - the node value should be greater than or equal to its children.
    - the largest element should be the root node
